Leave Tracker Android application

This is an application for tracking different types of paid leave. There are three customizable categories and users can also see how much leave will be available on a certain date.

The point of this is mainly to learn how to write Android apps, so there's definitely going to be sub-optimal code in here for a while.

Needs View Pager Indicator and ActionBarSherlock included as library projects.
